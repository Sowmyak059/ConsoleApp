# **Learning Project: [C# Console application]**

## **Overview**
This project is a learning exercise to explore and implement concepts in **C#**. 
It focuses on **object-oriented programming, .NET Core, LINQ** allowing me to gain practical experience and build a foundational understanding of the language and its ecosystem.

## **Objectives**
The key objectives of this project include:
- Learning the basics of **C# programming**.
- Exploring and Implementing core concepts like **OOP principles, programming**.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET Core
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
- **Testing Framework**: 

## **Features**
- **[Feature 1]**: [e.g., Implements basic CRUD operations using Entity Framework.]
- **[Feature 2]**: [e.g., Demonstrates multithreading and asynchronous operations.]
- **[Feature 3]**: [e.g., A small console application for managing tasks.]
